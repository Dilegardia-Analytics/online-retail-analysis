# online-retail-analysis

Overview

This project presents a full data quality audit, exploratory analysis, and business-driven strategy assessment of transactional data from an online retail company.
The objective is not only to describe historical performance, but to translate data insights into concrete commercial recommendations related to product strategy, pricing actions, customer risk, and geographic dependence.

The analysis is designed to mirror the workflow of an entry-level data analyst working with real business stakeholders.

Business Questions Addressed
	•	When does the business generate most of its revenue?
	•	Is revenue growth driven by pricing or sales volume?
	•	Which products should be protected, promoted, discounted, or discontinued?
	•	How concentrated is revenue across customers and countries?
	•	Where do operational or strategic risks exist?

⸻

Dataset
	•	Source: Online retail transactional data
	•	Period: December 2010 – December 2011
	•	Initial size: ~541,000 transactions
	•	Validated analysis base: ~530,000 genuine sales transactions

Each transaction includes invoice details, product information, quantities, prices, customer identifiers, timestamps, and country.

Methodology

The project follows a business-first analytical workflow:
	1.	Data Quality Audit
	•	Identification of cancellations, returns, zero-priced records
	•	Separation of operational charges (postage, manual adjustments)
	•	Validation of quantities, prices, and timestamps
	2.	Revenue & Seasonality Analysis
	•	Monthly revenue trends
	•	Identification of seasonal demand patterns
	3.	Revenue Drivers
	•	Decomposition of revenue into volume vs price effects
	4.	Product Performance Analysis
	•	Top products by revenue and by demand
	•	Separation of traffic drivers vs value drivers
	5.	Customer & Geographic Concentration
	•	Revenue concentration across customers
	•	Country-level dependency analysis
	6.	Strategic Product Segmentation
	•	Classification into:
	•	Core Drivers
	•	Traffic Drivers
	•	Premium Opportunities
	•	Underperformers

⸻

Key Insights
	•	Revenue growth is volume-driven, not price-driven
	•	A small subset of products forms the core revenue backbone
	•	A large portion of the catalog underperforms and adds operational complexity
	•	Revenue is highly concentrated among top customers
	•	The business is geographically dependent on the UK market

⸻

Strategic Recommendations
	•	Protect and prioritize availability of core revenue products
	•	Use high-volume, low-price items for bundling and traffic generation
	•	Improve visibility of premium products instead of discounting them
	•	Consider clearance or removal of low-value, low-demand items
	•	Reduce dependency risk by diversifying customers and markets
